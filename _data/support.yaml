    And when you make that commitment to yourself to get the direct support 
    you need for your projects, you will also receive two, four, six, or eight 
    months of membership at the Writing Table — depending on how many coaching 
    sessions you choose. This is a great way to get layers of help and support 
    for your work.[Visit the 3MMM shop to learn more about individual coaching options, which include membership at the Writing Table.](https://eileencampbellreed.org/product/coaching-writing-table/)
