      Writing Table is a space for books, dissertations, journal articles, 
      fiction, non-fiction, creative writing, sermons, *journaling*, and more.
history: | 
      In the early **pandemic days**, students, pastors, professors, and authors 
      were feeling a lot of stress on our writing and our lives. We needed a place to show up and be together in our work. We needed a community of practice. And so the Writing Table was born.
